# Junos (Juniper) VPN for GNU/Linux (Debian/Ubuntu...)

This is a helper script to install the commands junos_start and junos_route
into your System. These are wrappers to establish a connection to a Junos VPN.

The junos_route tool is a little helper, that helps you if the routes are not
optimal. Most of the time you just want the private network ips to be mapped,
but not the public ones.

Thanks to authors of the following articles, which helped me to figure out, how
to run the Junos VPN on linux!
